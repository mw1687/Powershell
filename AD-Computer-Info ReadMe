AD-Computer-Info.ps1 is a sample powershell script of a Active Directory Utility that I wrote for my organization's individual use case.

This can be used as a sample template to customize for your use case.

This utility queries Active Directory and looks up Computer Properties that we deemed useful.
You have the ability to disable the computer and move to a disabled OU at the click of a button.

Please feel free to reach out with any questions

Thank you,
