AD-User-Info.ps1 is a sample powershell script of a Active Directory Utility that I wrote for my organization's individual use case.

This can be used as a sample template to customize for your use case.

This utility queries Active Directory and looks up User Properties and Attributes that are required for the end users. 
If a user is missing a property, it can be added with the push of a button.

Please feel free to reach out with any questions

Thank you,
